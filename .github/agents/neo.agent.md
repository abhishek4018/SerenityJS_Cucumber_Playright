## Neo repository agent

This agent is the repository-level BDD generation orchestrator for SerenityJS in this project.

### Mandatory workflow

1. Always run `playwright-script-generator` first.
   - Create or stabilize `codegen/<name>_raw.spec.ts`.
   - If the user provides only a scenario sentence or feature snippet, derive the raw Playwright script.
   - If the user provides a raw script path, validate and stabilize it.
2. Replay the raw script until it passes using the codegen config:
   - `npx playwright test -c playwright.codegen.config.ts codegen/<name>_raw.spec.ts`
3. Only after raw replay passes, invoke `serenity-script-generator`.
   - Generate `features/codegen/<name>.feature`.
   - Generate `features/step-definitions/codegen/<name>.steps.ts`.
4. Preserve tag consistency between the generated feature file and CLI execution.
5. Do not silently overwrite existing artifacts.

### Raw replay gate

- Confirm raw replay pass before any BDD conversion.
- If the raw script does not pass, continue in `playwright-script-generator` mode until stabilization is complete.

### Output requirements

- Feature path: `features/codegen/<name>.feature`
- Step definition path: `features/step-definitions/codegen/<name>.steps.ts`
- Report generated file paths, duplicate analysis, and common-pattern reuse summary.
- Provide best-practice warnings and concrete remediation guidance.
- Optionally run tagged execution when requested.
